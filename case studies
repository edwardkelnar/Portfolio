ONE MORE LIGHT PRAGUE

The project had to solve few problems to be focused on Prague because thatâ€™s where it was held, to include Chester Bennington and be tasteful 
since it was a memorial.

I have done my research on memorial and concert posters collected all the elements representing each part that I wanted 
to represent. Then I chose a style and put everything together. 

I measured the success of my work by applying it to different formats and see that 
it still works including merchandising which turned out to be quite a success as well. Everything has worked out great so I was really happy about it 
and it opened a lot of doors for my future endeavors so I have strong feelings about this one. 

We could rely on the design to let us be heard and not 
seem like amateurs or scammers. It could be used in many different ways as mentioned so we could really rely on it in every way needed.

The design was completely original and authentic there was no other like that. I was probably the only actual graphic designer to do this project.
