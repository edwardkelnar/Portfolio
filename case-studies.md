## ONE MORE LIGHT PRAGUE - Live show visual

I designed a visual identity for a Prague memorial for the late Chester Bennington back in 2017. It was an important project for me because 
of my relationship to the music and the band. I had the opportunity to work on the memorial show for him and the fans. We really wanted to 
make it as great as possible so all the people can grief in the best way possible and cope with their loss among friends and family. Other 
than this project being personal to me and a lot of other people around me there as another factor. It opened a lot of doors from me because 
of all the people I’ve met and also my point of view. So even though this is not the best thing I’ve done it is the most important one for sure.

The project had to solve a few problems to be focused on Prague because that’s where it was held and I had to incorporate it in the design, include 
Chester Bennington within rights and everything and it had to be tasteful since it was a memorial.

I have done my research on memorial and concert posters collected all the elements representing each part that I wanted to represent. Then I chose 
a style and put everything together. I liked a kind of dark but not super depressing style with a lot of cool brushes and splashes that created 
a unique look and also connected all the elements nicely together.

I measured the success of my work by applying it to different formats and see that it still works including merchandising which turned out to be 
quite a success as well. Everything has worked out great so I was really happy about it and it opened a lot of doors for my future endeavors so 
I have strong feelings about this project as I already mentioned. 

We could rely on the design to let us be heard and not seem like amateurs or 
scammers. It could be used in many different ways as mentioned so we could really rely on it in every way needed.

The design was completely original and authentic there was no other like that. It was the most successful memorial concert in Czech Republic at 
least by the people which attended more of them or at least this one.
