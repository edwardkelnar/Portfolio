Top 3 stuff I've recently done


## Social Media Design
##### For over a year I've been working on social media. Right now I work with Hitradio City. I've been there only a few months but over the time I started working on their visual identity as well. It is very limited with the content and timing of creating each post but also I have some freedom as a most graphicaly expirienced in the studio. Here is a little preview of my work.

## Graphic Design - Poster
##### This is not my recent work actually it is from 2018 but it was my favorite project to work on because I could be myslef and pay a tribute to my heroes. It is a poster for a tribute concert that me and few of my friedns put together to celebrate the late singer Chester Bennington.
