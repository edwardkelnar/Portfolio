I am a perfectionist but I’m also kind of procrastinator and I rush things so I spend much more time on each project than I need to.

When I’m not designing or working I usually try to rest by slacking off or relaxing a bit
but I usualy need to do something to be busy. So I have like a dozen open projects and keep on beginning new ones but only few of them 
get finished if any.
