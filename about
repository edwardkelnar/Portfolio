I am a perfectionist but I’m also lazy and I rush things so I spend much more time on everything than I need.

When I’m not designing or working I usually try to rest or keep myself calm by slacking off or relaxing
but it doesn’t work so I always need to do something and that makes me even more tired. So I have like a dozen
projects open and keep on beginning new ones but only few get finished if any.
